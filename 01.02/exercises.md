# Exercise 1.9

Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures `inc`, which increments its argument by 1, and `dec`, which decrements its argument by 1.

```lisp
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) 
      b 
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) 
      b 
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating `(+ 4 5)`. Are these processes iterative or recursive?

## Answer

```lisp
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
```

This process is recursive, as there are deferred `inc` operations the interpreter has to keep track of.

```lisp
(+ 4 5)
(+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
(+ 3 6)
(+ (dec 3) (inc 6))
(+ 2 7)
(+ (dec 2) (inc 7))
(+ 1 8)
(+ (dec 1) (inc 8))
(+ 0 9)
9
```

This process is iterative. The entire state of the running operation is kept in variables which are passed to each iteration of the procedure.


# Exercise 1.10

The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Ackermannâ€™s function.

```lisp
(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1)
                 (A x (- y 1))))))
```

What are the values of the following expressions?

```lisp
(A 1 10)
(A 2 4)
(A 3 3)
```

## Answer

```lisp
(A 1 10)

(A (- 1 1)
   (A 1 (- 10 1)))

(A 0 (A 1 9))

(A 0 (A (- 1 1)

## Part 2

Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:

```lisp
(define (f n) (A 0 n))
(define (g n) (A 1 n))
(define (h n) (A 2 n))
(define (k n) (* 5 n n))
```

Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the procedures `f`, `g`, and `h` for positive integer values of `n` . For example, `(k n)` computes $ 5n^2 $.

## Answer

```lisp
(f n)
(A 0 n)
(* 2 n)
```
$$ f(n) = 2n $$

```lisp
(g n)
(A 1 n)
(A 0 (A 1 (- n 1)))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 1 (- n 2))))
...
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (...(A 1 1))))
```
$$ g(n) =  2^n $$

```lisp
(h 1)
(A 2 1)
2

(h 2)
(A 2 2)
(A 1 (A 2 1))
(A 1 2)
(A 0 (A 1 1))
(A 0 2)
4

(h 3)
(A 2 3)
(A 1 (A 2 2))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 2 1)))
(A 1 (A 1 2))
(A 1 (A 0 (A 1 1)))
(A 1 (A 0 2))
(A 1 4)
(A 0 (A 1 3))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 1 2)))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 1))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 2)))
(A 0 (A 0 4))
(A 0 8)
16

(h 4)
(A 2 4)
(A 1 (A 2 3))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 2 2)))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 1 (A 2 1))))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 1 2)))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 0 (A 1 1))))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 0 2)))
(A 1 (A 1 4))
(A 1 (A 0 (A 1 3)))
(A 1 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 2))))
(A 1 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 1)))))
(A 1 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 2))))
(A 1 (A 0 (A 0 4)))
(A 1 (A 0 8))
(A 1 16)
```

$$ h(1) = 2, h(n) = 2^{h(n-1)} $$
